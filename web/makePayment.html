                        See our FAQs for details on how to register to receive your notice by email, change your postal address or what to do if you have misplaced 
                        your rates notice.
                    
                        Payment dates
                        Rates notices for 2023–24 will be sent to ratepayers in August 2023.
                        
                        You can pay your rates notice in one of three ways:
                        
                        Option 1: one lump sum on, or before, 15 February 2024
                        Option 2: four equal instalments
                        Option 3: 10 monthly payments (by direct debit only).
                        If you choose to pay in four instalments, the date for each instalment is as follows:
                        
                        Instalment 1: 30 September 2023
                        Instalment 2: 30 November 2023
                        Instalment 3: 28 February 2024
                        Instalment 4: 31 May 2024.
                        If you choose to pay 10 monthly payments (by direct debit only), payments will be deducted from your nominated account on the last day of the 
                        months of September through to May, with the final payment for June deducted two working days prior to 30 June 2024. If we are not able to 
                        debit your account due to insufficient funds, we will issue you an updated statement with 10 per cent interest added, notifying you that 
                        we will attempt to debit​ your account again. 
                        
                        You can sign up to pay by direct debit by submitting a direct debit authorisation form. See below for more information.


                        Overdue rates
When you pay your rates and charges, it is essential that we receive your payment by the due dates, as shown on your annual rates notice.

City of Melbourne charges interest on late payments,  in accordance with Section 172 of the Local Government Act 1989. Interest is charged at the penalty 
interest rate which is currently 10 per cent per annum, as fixed under Section 2 of the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983.

Penalty interest on any arrears of rates and charges will continue to accrue. Interest will be calculated from the date when each quarterly instalment was due,
irrespective of whether or not a ratepayer has chosen to pay by the instalment or lump sum option.
